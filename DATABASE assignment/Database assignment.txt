1.		SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees, MIN(moSalary) AS MinSalary,
		COUNT(distinct ntLevel) AS Total_Distinct_ntLevel 
		FROM tblEmp;



2.		SELECT e.ntEmpID, e.vcName,e.vcMobieNumer
		FROM tblEmp AS e;

3.		IF ((SELECT DISTINCT ntLevel FROM tblEmp WHERE vcMobieNumer IS NULL AND ntLevel=1) >0)
		BEGIN
		   SELECT * FROM tblEmp WHERE vcMobieNumer IS NULL AND ntLevel=1
		END
		ELSE
		BEGIN
			SELECT * FROM tblEmp WHERE ntLevel=0
		END



4.		SELECT *,
		CASE 
			WHEN vcSkills LIKE '%JavaScript%' THEN 1
			ELSE 0
		END AS priority
		FROM tblEmp 
		ORDER BY priority DESC;



5. 		Explain the TOP clause in the following sql queries?
    
		a. SELECT TOP(1) * FROM tblEmp 
	
	Ans:	It will return the top 'n' rows of the result set retrieved, 'n' being the number specified inside
		the Top clause.
		For example, TOP(10) would return the top 10 rows of the full result set.
		
		b. SELECT TOP(SELECT 3/2) * FROM tblEmp 
	
	Ans:	It will return the top 'n' rows of the result set retrieved, 'n' being converted into integer first
		and specified inside the Top clause.
		For example, TOP(10/3) would return the top (10/3) = 3 rows of the full result set.
	
		c. SELECT TOP(1) PERCENT * FROM tblEmp
	
	Ans:	It will return the top rows of the result set retrieved based on percentage, 'n' being the percentage
		specified inside the Top clause.
		For example, TOP(10) PERCENT would return the top 10% rows of the full result set.
		
		d. SELECT TOP(1) WITH TIES * FROM tblEmp ORDER BY vcName
	
	Ans:	TOP clause is commonly used to get top required rows FROM a result set,also it can be used with
		WITH TIES clause, to retrieve all similar rows to base result set.	




6.		When I executed this query:
           
		SELECT [vcName],[vcMobieNumer] FROM [dbo].[tblEmp] GROUP BY [vcName]

	Ans:	The column names in SELECT clause and GROUP BY clause should be same.
		two ways to correct this query:
		(a) Remove [vcMobieNumer] FROM SELECT clause
		(b) Add [vcMobieNumer] into GROUP BY clause

		AND ProductDescription.ProductDescriptionID = '736';		
		
	
13.		SELECT Name,OrderQty,ListPrice 
		FROM Sales.Customer,Sales.Store,Sales.SalesOrderDetail,Production.ProductListPriceHistory
		WHERE Customer.CustomerID = 635
		AND Customer.ProductID = ProductListPriceHistory.ProductID;

		FROM Person.Address, Production.ProductSubcategory
		WHERE Address.city = 'london'
		AND ProductSubcategory.Name = 'Cranksets';	
	
	
15.		Char DataType
		Char datatype which is used to store fixed length of characters. Suppose if we declared char(50)
		it will allocates memory for 50 characters. Once we declare char(50) and insert only 10 characters
		of word then only 10 characters of memory will be used and other 40 characters of memory will be wasted.

		varchar DataType
		Varchar means variable characters and it is used to store non-unicode characters. It will allocate
		the memory based on number characters inserted. Suppose if we declared varchar(50) it will allocates
		memory of 0 characters at the time of declaration. Once we declare varchar(50) and insert only 10 
		characters of word it will allocate memory for only 10 characters.

		nvarchar DataType
		nvarchar datatype same as varchar datatype but only difference nvarchar is used to store Unicode 
		characters and it allows you to store multiple languages in database. nvarchar datatype will take 
		twice as much space to store extended set of characters as required by other languages.
		So if we are not using other languages then itâ€™s better to use varchar datatype instead of nvarchar
