1. (a)    select COUNT(*) from tblEmp;
   (b)    select min(moSalary) from tblEmp;
   (c)    select count(distinct ntLevel) from tblEmp;

//combining

select COUNT(*)as TotalEmployees ,min(moSalary) as MinSalary,
count(distinct ntLevel) as Total_Distinct_ntLevel from tblEmp;



2.      SELECT E.[ntEmpID], E.[vcName],E.[vcMobieNumer]
		FROM tblEmp as E;



3. (a)    select * from tblEmp where vcMobieNumer is null AND ntLevel=1;
   (b)    select * from tblEmp where ntLevel=0;


//combining


IF ((select distinct ntLevel from tblEmp where vcMobieNumer is null AND ntLevel=1) >0)
BEGIN
   select * from tblEmp where vcMobieNumer is null AND ntLevel=1
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    select * from tblEmp where ntLevel=0
END



4.       select *
		,case when vcSkills like '%Java%' then 1
         
		end as [priority]
		from tblEmp 
		order by [priority] desc;








5. Explain the TOP clause in the following sql queries?
    
    a. SELECT TOP(1) * FROM tblEmp 
	
Ans: It will return the top 'n' rows of the result set retrieved, 'n' being the number specified inside
	the Top clause.
		For example, TOP(10) would return the top 10 rows of the full result set.
		
    b. SELECT TOP(SELECT 3/2) * FROM tblEmp 
	
Ans: It will return the top 'n' rows of the result set retrieved, 'n' being converted into integer first
	and specified inside the Top clause.
		For example, TOP(10/3) would return the top (10/3) = 3 rows of the full result set.
	
    c. SELECT TOP(1) PERCENT * FROM tblEmp
	
Ans: It will return the top rows of the result set retrieved based on percentage, 'n' being the percentage
	specified inside the Top clause.
		For example, TOP(10) PERCENT would return the top 10% rows of the full result set.
		
    d. SELECT TOP(1) WITH TIES * FROM tblEmp ORDER BY vcName
	
Ans: TOP clause is commonly used to get top required rows from a result set,also it can be used with
	 WITH TIES clause, to retrieve all similar rows to base result set.	





6. When I executed this query:
           
   SELECT [vcName],[vcMobieNumer] FROM [dbo].[tblEmp] GROUP BY [vcName]

Ans: The column names in SELECT clause and GROUP BY clause should be same.
		two ways to correct this query:
	(a) Remove [vcMobieNumer] from SELECT clause
	(b) Add [vcMobieNumer] into GROUP By clause


7.      SELECT vcName,ntLevel  FROM tblEmp where moSalary>(select AVG(moSalary) from tblEmp) ;



8.      select * from HumanResources.Employee
